      "message": "Yeah, it didn\u0027t make sense to me when I first read it. I suspect that this should also be a decreasing function in qindex, but I\u0027m not sure yet. It\u0027s definitely worth testing.\n\nResidual blocks that come from inter coding might have different spectral properties that could justify encoding high frequencies more faithfully (the higher the frame is in the hierarchical temporal level pyramid, the higher the average SB qindex, and the higher the chances RDO picking inter coding for blocks instead of intra). Or maybe this is just a function that was implemented to showcase QMs as a coding tool, and it never got tuned since it was checked in.\n\nUltimately, we want to do the convex the hull optimization operation with representative videos to find out the answer, like we did for pictures.",
