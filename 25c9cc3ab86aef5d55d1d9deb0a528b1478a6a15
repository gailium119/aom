      "message": "Looking at https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/194303, I think the preference might have been the preset method, rather than a new usage; it\u0027s a little confusing to have all-intra (which is mostly used for still pictures) and a still picture usage. I\u0027ll let Wan-Teh elaborate.\n\nIn general, with any change to add a preset or usage the tests should be extended to cover them. See `test/allintra_end_to_end_test.cc` for example.",

      "message": "James is right. I was suggesting using the preset method with the `AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA` usage.\n\nJingning (cc\u0027ed) added the `AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA` usage for AVIF still images. Although the name \"all intra\" suggests that this usage can also be used for all-intra videos, it is intended for still pictures. You can treat `AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA` as if it were named `AOM_USAGE_STILL_PICTURE`.\n\nWe should re-evaluate this if you need to make `AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA` unsuitable for all-intra videos. Do you anticipate this will happen? It\u0027s not clear why we might need to treat still pictures and all-intra videos differently...\n\nNote: We can always encode all-intra videos with the `AOM_USAGE_GOOD_QUALITY` usage and the `--kf_max_dist\u003d0` option. So it is not really a problem to make `AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA` unsuitable for all-intra videos.",
