      "message": "Looking at https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/194303, I think the preference might have been the preset method, rather than a new usage; it\u0027s a little confusing to have all-intra (which is mostly used for still pictures) and a still picture usage. I\u0027ll let Wan-Teh elaborate.\n\nIn general, with any change to add a preset or usage the tests should be extended to cover them. See `test/allintra_end_to_end_test.cc` for example.",
