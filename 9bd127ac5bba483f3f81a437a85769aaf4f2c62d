While the new mode is mainly guided by SSIMU2, it doesn\u0027t blindly maximize the metric without a corresponding subjective quality improvement.\n\nOther names that could hit the right scope (not too wide, not too narrow) could be:\n- `PSYCHOVISUAL`\n- `STILL_PICTURE`\n- `PERCEPT_METRIC` (Gemini suggested this one)",
