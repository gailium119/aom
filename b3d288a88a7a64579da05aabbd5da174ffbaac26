      "message": "Great questions.\n\nSo, the original formula `aom_get_qmlevel_allintra()` was indeed tuned for SSIMULACRA2. However, after realizing that using the `aom_get_qmlevel()` formula made zero sense for all intra content in general (due to the increasing vs. decreasing function in qindex nature), we essentially \"promoted\" `aom_get_qmlevel_allintra()` to run in all intra mode (independently of the tuning), if the user enables QMs.\n\nWith this new QM formula however, we\u0027re explicitly altering chroma vs. luma bit ratio distribution, in a way that I can\u0027t guarantee metrics like PSNR YUV or SSIM YUV won\u0027t regress. This means it\u0027s best for us to keep using `aom_get_qmlevel_allintra()` for all intra mode outside the SSIMULACRA 2 tune.\n\nFor reference, a similar case happened with the chroma 444 formula: https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/195261.",
