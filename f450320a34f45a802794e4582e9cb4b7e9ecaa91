      "message": "The procedure you used to determine this function seems exactly the same as the procesure you used to determine the `aom_get_qmlevel_allintra()` function (see lines 65-69). If so, then these two functions should be used under the same condition, either\n\n- in all intra mode (regardless of the tune metric), or\n- in all intra mode and SSIMULACRA 2 tune.\n\nIs my understanding correct?",

      "message": "You\u0027re correct in that the procedure itself was the same between `aom_get_qmlevel_allintra()` and this new formula.\n\nHowever, there was the situation where using the original `aom_get_qmlevel()` for all intra just plain didn\u0027t make sense (because of the qindex -\u003e QM level graph growing the wrong way), so it followed we enabled it for the all intra mode.\n\nFor the 4:4:4 chroma formula however, we\u0027re effectively rebalancing bit allocation so luma gets a bit more of the share of budget relative to chroma. While this is good for SSIMULACRA 2 (and also benefits overall quality to my eyes), I can\u0027t guarantee this will be beneficial for other metrics, especially weighted YUV PSNR/SSIM metrics that might expect the chroma planes to score better so the weighted average is higher.\n\nHope this explains the reasoning.",
